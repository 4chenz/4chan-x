# 4chan X

## [Install](https://ccd0.github.io/4chan-x/builds/4chan-X.user.js) (Firefox)
Install [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/versions/2.1), then click the link above to install.

**Important**: If you are using Greasemonkey 2.0, you should update to the [latest version](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/). Otherwise you may be subject to a [bug](https://github.com/greasemonkey/greasemonkey/issues/1938), fixed in version 2.1, which prevents Greasemonkey from updating 4chan X and other userscripts to the latest version. After doing so, you may want to update 4chan X manually since it is likely to be out of date.

Greasemonkey 2.1 also fixed [another bug](https://github.com/greasemonkey/greasemonkey/issues/1937) that can break posting of images from URLs and downloading images with the original filename.

### Known issues<!-- Firefox -->
The combination of Firefox 29 and Greasemonkey 2.0+ causes 4chan X not to work.
If you have this problem, you should [upgrade Firefox](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) to version 30 or higher.
Alternatively, you can downgrade to [Greasemonkey 1.15](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/versions/#version-1.15) and turn off automatic updates for Greasemonkey ([see pic](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ccd0/4chan-x/master/img/2014-07-12_16-19-32.png)).

## [Install](https://ccd0.github.io/4chan-x/builds/4chan-X.crx) (Chromium)
Download the file from the link above and add drag it to your `chrome://extensions` page.
This should also work for non-Windows/dev/canary Chrome and Chromium-based versions of Opera.

## [Install](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/4chan-x/ohnjgmpcibpbafdlkimncjhflgedgpam) (Chrome store)
The stable and beta releases of Chrome on Windows will disable extensions not installed from the Chrome store, so users will need to install 4chan X from the link above.
Only the latest stable version of 4chan X is available.

### Known issues<!-- Chromium -->
Some recent versions of Chromium/Chrome (38.0.2085 - 38.0.2103) (and versions of Opera based on them) suffer from a (now fixed) [bug](https://crbug.com/393686) that prevents extensions from making HTTP requests if more than one extension is enabled. This breaks, among other things, thread updating, quick reply, and, when `JSON Navigation` is enabled, the thread index. If you are experiencing this, try using another version of Chromium/Chrome/Opera, disabling your other extensions, or using a different browser.

## Other browsers
This fork of 4chan X is not guaranteed to work correctly in other browsers, but you are welcome to try your luck. Pull requests to fix the bugs you will likely find are always welcome. You may fare better with [loadletter's v2 fork](https://github.com/loadletter/4chan-x), which has fewer features but less dependence on browser-specific APIs.
