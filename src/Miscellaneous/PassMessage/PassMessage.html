      You can buy solved CAPTCHAs at <%= meta.captchaServiceLinks.map(function(x) {return x[0]}).join(', ') %>, and similar services. 
      They&#039;re a bit slow, but sufficient for image dumping. 
      Depending on how much you post, this can be cheaper than a Pass, and it doesn&#039;t require cryptocurrency to purchase. 
      4chan X has integrated support for services that use 2captcha&#039;s API. 
      Go to <b>Advanced &gt; Captcha Solving Service</b> in the settings panel to set it up.

    <p>
      If you&#039;re thinking of buying a Pass because of annoying &quot;Click verify once there are none left&quot; captchas, you may be able to get rid of them for free by checking <b>Force Noscript Captcha</b> in your settings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most imageboards either don&#039;t require captchas to post at all or require them only in limited circumstances. 
      Consider using another site. 
      4chan X works on many Tinyboard-based sites by default, and if your preferred site isn&#039;t on the default list, you can enable 4chan X on it by following <a href="<%= meta.faq %>#other-imageboards" target="_blank" rel="noopener">these instructions</a>.
